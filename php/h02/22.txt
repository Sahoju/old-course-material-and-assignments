'Will you do this for me?' it asked, and I said that I would.<br/><br/>

I promised the hive that I would contact someone I could trust, that I would have them destroy all evidence of this place, just as my father had promised himself. I, however, will not make the same mistakes my father made - you now understand the truth of the events that lead me here, and the immeasurable importance of my words. Armed with this knowledge, you must have the strength to do that which I could not.<br/><br/>

The Tuurngait was quite correct - we humans are a dangerous, headless herd, but intelligent individuals. The members of this facility sought to reveal and control the Tuurngait, and the Tuurngait turned to me for salvation. The hive ran its tests on me - and I jumped through its hoops like the monkey it took me for.<br/><br/>

But I am no monkey.<br/><br/>

The Tuurngait was right -  I am entirely unlike it: I had more in common with Clarence.<br/><br/>

I promised I would send this email to you. I promised I would ask that you keep all humans from this place - for the sake of the Tuurngait, and for the human race. I lied.<br/><br/>

If we are lucky, then by the time you read this, I will be dead.<br/><br/>

If fate frowns, we all perish.<br/><br/>
