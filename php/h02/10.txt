As I stepped into the mouth of the underground facility, there should have been questions, fears, doubts running through me. Instead, I was torn in two.<br/><br/>

Part of me, I felt, had died, along with my only ally, and friend. His final words had raised more questions than they'd answered, and I couldn't get his screams for help out of my head, despite knowing, deep down, that the pain I had caused Red was, itself, all the help I could have offered him. I was alone again, but I had nothing to do, other than press on into the unknown.<br/><br/>

If I'd felt so bad about Red, I should have listened to him and stayed where I was. I would trade his fate a hundred times for my own.<br/><br/>

The other side of me was looking forward, to what might await me in my continued journey. I felt sure that I would soon find some clue or other to my father's fate, and that he was inextricably linked to everything that was happening.<br/><br/>

I also couldn't help but suspect that everything I had seen up until that point was just symptomatic of whatever lay beyond the threshold.<br/><br/>

I know now, I was right.
