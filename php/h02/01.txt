<i>My story began in February, year 2000</i><br/><br/>

For my part in this allegory, I'm not going to make the same mistake my father made.<br/><br/>

Howard vanished from my mother's life before I was even in it, so when he sent me a letter, a few days after mum's funeral, it was the first I'd ever heard from him.<br/><br/>

A pity he was dead. Writing from beyond the grave must be a genetic habit in my bloodline.<br/><br/>

His letter contained a key, instructions, pleas for forgiveness. I figured the dead don't have much use for absolution, so I turned his prophetic passing, which he inexplicably expected to come any day.<br/><br/>

Clearly averse to explanations, my father preferred to leave directions to a bank on Mayfair I'd never even heard of. In that bank was a safety deposit box in his name, and myself as executor.<br/><br/>

Of course, I went, as he knew I would.<br/><br/>

I discovered that despite the evidence, he'd been legally declared dead almost thirty years ago, and so the old book, and collection of notes I found had, in the eyes of the law been, mine all this time.<br/><br/>

My father's instructions were to burn the documents, raise no further questions. But that was his error. No man is immune to the shameful trappings of curiosity and... my humanity got the better of me.<br/><br/>

The university I taught at was world renowned for two things: physics, and linguistics. I represented the first, and the man who stood for the second was stumped by my recent acquisition.<br/><br/>

The book was indecipherable. The notes, however, showed a location somewhere in uninhabited Northern Greenland.<br/><br/>

It took me almost a year to book the last flight I would ever take.<br/><br/>

As I watched civilisation disappear, along with Heathrow, I realised my father had disappeared three decades ago, almost to the day, and I considered in turn, what it was that I was leaving behind.<br/><br/>

We landed on a strip of ice a few feet wide, and within minutes I was pulling away on a chartered boat, beginning the 12 hour journey that would lead me into my past.
