I chose to lead you here. You and all the others, with their weapons and their instruments and their orders. There will be fighting, pain, suffering and, eventually, triumph for just one.<br/><br/>

Why would I do this, you might wonder. Am I insane? Did Clarence change me, is Swanson calling me, is it revenge for what the Tuurngait did to Red?<br/><br/>

It is none of these things, though there is some truth in each.<br/><br/>

'But the Tuurngait offered peace' you might say. I could have kept the secret, died with it as my father did.<br/><br/>

But that would make me like all the others. It would make me like the miners who built this place - working because they are told to, because they see no other option. It would make me like the Archaic - blindly pursuing a single goal, a great organism working together, but each element without direction. Perhaps they were not so unlike the Tuurngait.<br/><br/>

It would make me become the person I was when I came to this place - blindly following a path laid out for me without my consent. Though I have suffered immeasurably in this place, I feel as if my life only began when I arrived here.<br/><br/>

For the first time I disconnected from the instruction of society. For the first time I thought for myself - I had to. And in that way, Red, Clarence and I are more human than you will ever be. Because you will do as you are told. You will inform the authorities, because you are one of the herd.<br/><br/>

But this is my identity. Better to make your own mistakes than to feed off someone else's triumphs. Better to choose hell than be assigned to heaven.<br/><br/>

No matter what you may think, it is always better to think.
