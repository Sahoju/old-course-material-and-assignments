When I look back, I can't think what spurred me to go deeper into the mine. Perhaps it was arrogance at still being alive; or something as ridiculous as facing adversity, and coming out on top.<br/><br/>

Now, I know I would have been better off starving, or being mauled to death, than kickstarting the chain of events that led me to end up here, writing to you. I just hope, once you understand my story, you will have what's necessary to put an end to this tale.<br/><br/>

I certainly didn't.
