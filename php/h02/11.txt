Without this knowledge, without this foundation, you could not have the will to do what I must now ask of you.<br/><br/>

I followed my father to the Greenland wastes to uncover his secrets. You had to know how far I was willing to go.<br/><br/>

I found a disuses mining shaft, and took shelter from the storm. You had to know how desperate I was.<br/><br/>

I was plagued by doubts, fears, and mysteries, and aided by a madman, Red. You had to know how lonely I was.<br/><br/>

I incinerated my best friend - Red told me he wanted to die. You had to know how guilty I felt.<br/><br/>

I ventured boldly onwards, and was struck down by my own heroics. You had to know how stupid I was.<br/><br/>

All of these things - so human, so perfect. And yet still I failed to do what I must now ask of you.
